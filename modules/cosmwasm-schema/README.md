# CosmWasm Schema

This module contains the `schema` types used to interact with the SatLayer CosmWasm smart contracts.
Go files in `./contract/schema.go` are generated (please do not edit them manually) from
the `schema.json` for each cw crate.
We use turborepo (`turbo.json`) to manage the build process.
