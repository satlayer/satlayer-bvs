//
// Declares that a fixed weight of yes votes is needed to pass. It does not matter how many
// no votes are cast, or how many do not vote, as long as `weight` yes votes are cast.
//
// This is the simplest format and usually suitable for small multisigs of trusted parties,
// like 3 of 5. (weight: 3, total_weight: 5)
//
// A proposal of this type can pass early as soon as the needed weight of yes votes has been
// cast.
//
// Declares a percentage of the total weight that must cast Yes votes, in order for a
// proposal to pass. The passing weight is computed over the total weight minus the weight
// of the abstained votes.
//
// This is useful for similar circumstances as `AbsoluteCount`, where we have a relatively
// small set of voters, and participation is required. It is understood that if the voting
// set (group) changes between different proposals that refer to the same group, each
// proposal will work with a different set of voter weights (the ones snapshotted at
// proposal creation), and the passing weight for each proposal will be computed based on
// the absolute percentage, times the total weights of the members at the time of each
// proposal creation.
//
// Example: we set `percentage` to 51%. Proposal 1 starts when there is a `total_weight` of
// 5. This will require 3 weight of Yes votes in order to pass. Later, the Proposal 2 starts
// but the `total_weight` of the group has increased to 9. That proposal will then
// automatically require 5 Yes of 9 to pass, rather than 3 yes of 9 as would be the case
// with `AbsoluteCount`.
//
// In addition to a `threshold`, declares a `quorum` of the total votes that must
// participate in the election in order for the vote to be considered at all. Within the
// votes that were cast, it requires `threshold` votes in favor. That is calculated by
// ignoring the Abstain votes (they count towards `quorum`, but do not influence
// `threshold`). That is, we calculate `Yes / (Yes + No + Veto)` and compare it with
// `threshold` to consider if the proposal was passed.
//
// It is rather difficult for a proposal of this type to pass early. That can only happen if
// the required quorum has been already met, and there are already enough Yes votes for the
// proposal to pass.
//
// 30% Yes votes, 10% No votes, and 20% Abstain would pass early if quorum <= 60% (who has
// cast votes) and if the threshold is <= 37.5% (the remaining 40% voting no => 30% yes +
// 50% no). Once the voting period has passed with no additional votes, that same proposal
// would be considered successful if quorum <= 60% and threshold <= 75% (percent in favor if
// we ignore abstain votes).
//
// This type is more common in general elections, where participation is often expected to
// be low, and `AbsolutePercentage` would either be too high to pass anything, or allow low
// percentages to pass, independently of if there was high participation in the election or
// not.

//
// This is useful for similar circumstances as `AbsoluteCount`, where we have a relatively
// small set of voters, and participation is required. It is understood that if the voting
// set (group) changes between different proposals that refer to the same group, each
// proposal will work with a different set of voter weights (the ones snapshotted at
// proposal creation), and the passing weight for each proposal will be computed based on
// the absolute percentage, times the total weights of the members at the time of each
// proposal creation.
//
// Example: we set `percentage` to 51%. Proposal 1 starts when there is a `total_weight` of
// 5. This will require 3 weight of Yes votes in order to pass. Later, the Proposal 2 starts
// but the `total_weight` of the group has increased to 9. That proposal will then
// automatically require 5 Yes of 9 to pass, rather than 3 yes of 9 as would be the case
// with `AbsoluteCount`.
//
// In addition to a `threshold`, declares a `quorum` of the total votes that must
// participate in the election in order for the vote to be considered at all. Within the
// votes that were cast, it requires `threshold` votes in favor. That is calculated by
// ignoring the Abstain votes (they count towards `quorum`, but do not influence
// `threshold`). That is, we calculate `Yes / (Yes + No + Veto)` and compare it with
// `threshold` to consider if the proposal was passed.
//
// It is rather difficult for a proposal of this type to pass early. That can only happen if
// the required quorum has been already met, and there are already enough Yes votes for the
// proposal to pass.
//
// 30% Yes votes, 10% No votes, and 20% Abstain would pass early if quorum <= 60% (who has

// 50% no). Once the voting period has passed with no additional votes, that same proposal
// would be considered successful if quorum <= 60% and threshold <= 75% (percent in favor if
// we ignore abstain votes).
