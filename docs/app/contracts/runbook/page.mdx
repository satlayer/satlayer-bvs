# Contracts Runbook

> Ensure all the tools are installed. See `./README.md` for more information.
> **Run the commands from the root of the project.**

## Building Contracts

To build all the contracts, run the following command.
You can `--force` to make sure the contracts are built without using the cache.
We filter to `./crates/*` to build only the production contracts and not the examples.

```shell
turbo run build --force --filter="./crates/*"
```

The contracts will be built and stored in the `artifacts` directory.

```txt

## Deploying and Instantiating Contracts

<Steps>
  ### `.babylond/config/client.toml`
  Copy the `client.toml` file to the `.babylond/config` directory. (This is for `bbn-test-5`)

```toml filename=".babylond/config/client.toml" copy
chain-id = "bbn-test-5"
node = "https://babylon-testnet-rpc.nodes.guru"
keyring-backend = "os"
output = "text"
broadcast-mode = "block"
```

### Babylond

And start the interactive shell using the `babylond` docker image.

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/home/babylon docker.io/babylonlabs/babylond:v1.0.0-rc.6 sh
```

### Deployer Key

Add a new key for the deployer, if you haven't already.
You will be prompted to enter a password and save it, you will need this password to sign transactions.

```sh
babylond keys add deployer
```

Query the balance, make sure you have enough tokens to deploy the contracts.
Transfer them if necessary.

```sh
babylond query bank balances $(babylond keys show deployer -a)
```

### Store Contract

```shell
babylond tx wasm store path/to/artifacts/contract.wasm \
--from=deployer \
--gas=auto --gas-adjustment=1.3 --gas-prices=0.01ubbn \
--instantiate-anyof-addresses=$(babylond keys show deployer -a)
```

The most convenient way to get the `CODE_ID` is to query the list of codes and find the one you just uploaded.
The `creator:` field should match the address of the deployer.

```shell
babylond query wasm list-code --reverse --limit=3
```

Alternatively, query the transaction hash to get the `CODE_ID`.

```shell
CODE_ID=$(babylond query tx $TX_HASH --output=json \
| jq -r '.events[] | select(.type == "store_code") | .attributes[] | select(.key == "code_id") | .value')
echo $CODE_ID
```

### Instantiate Contract

Using the `CODE_ID` from the previous step, instantiate the contract.
The `--admin` is the address that will have admin rights over the contract.
This is set to the deployer in this example, in production we would set this to a multisig/governance contract.
Followed by the `CODE_ID` and the contract initialization parameters.

```shell
ADMIN=$(babylond keys show deployer -a)
CODE_ID=''
INIT_JSON=''
babylond tx wasm instantiate --from=deployer --admin=$ADMIN $CODE_ID $INIT_JSON
```

</Steps>
