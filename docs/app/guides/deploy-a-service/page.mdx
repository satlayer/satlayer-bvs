# Deploy a Service

Deploying a Service on the SatLayer platform involves several key steps, including setting up your development environment, writing the service code, and deploying it to the network. In this guide, we will provide a detailed walkthrough of each step, along with code examples and best practices.

We assume you have read the [What is a Service?](/architecture/services) section, review our [EVM examples](/evm/examples) and have a basic understanding of the SatLayer architecture, and how Services interact with Operators and the SatLayer contracts.
