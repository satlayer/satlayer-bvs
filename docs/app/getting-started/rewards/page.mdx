# Rewards

Rewards are the economic incentives
provided by [Services](/getting-started/services) to [Operators](/getting-started/operators) and Stakers for their participation
in securing the Service network.

BVS applications are expected to distribute their tokens as rewards to Bitcoin restakers who provide 
collateral for cryptoeconomic security, and operators who help with the validation.

To ensure a robust amount of Bitcoin assets for security and proper operator functioning, BVSs
must reward good behavior in the form of payments made to restakers and operators. The following
section explains how these payments work.

## Participants in the Rewards System

<Callout>
    In the SatLayer ecosystem, **Operators** and **Stakers** are collectively referred to as **Earners** when discussing the rewards distribution process.
</Callout>

In general, we have the following participants:

- **Operators** run the infrastructure and validation systems for the Services
- **Stakers** delegate their assets to Operators as part of the shared security model
- **Services** distribute rewards to both parties based on their contributions

## Rewards Workflow

### Distributing Rewards

The rewards distribution process follows these steps:

1. **Calculate Rewards**
- Services calculate rewards for each Earner based on their own criteria
- These calculations are recorded in a `distribution.json` file
that follows the [schema](https://github.com/satlayer/satlayer-rewards/blob/main/schema/distribution.schema.json)
- The file tracks **accumulative** rewards for each Earner

2. **Submit Distribution Data**
- Services can submit their `distribution.json` file to the [`satlayer-rewards`](https://github.com/satlayer/satlayer-rewards) repository as a PR
- GitHub Actions automatically generate and store the merkle tree in the repository
- This step simplifies the proof generation process for Earners
- Services can also generate the merkle root locally using the CLI from `@satlayer/cli`

3. **Execute Distribution**
- Services call `DistributeRewards` on the [`bvs-rewards`](/contracts/rewards) contract with the generated merkle root
- Before execution, Services must ensure that:
    - The reward tokens are available in sufficient amounts
    - Appropriate allowances are granted to the [`bvs-rewards`](/contracts/rewards) contract

### Claiming Rewards

Earners can claim their rewards through this process:

1. **Generate Proofs**
- Earners use `@satlayer/cli` to generate proofs
- Proofs are specific to each Service and token pair the Earner wishes to claim

2. **Execute Claim**
- Earners call `ClaimRewards` on the [`bvs-rewards`](/contracts/rewards) contract
- The call includes the merkle proof, leaf index, and other required parameters
