# Validated Service Lifecycle

SatLayer supports two types of services:

- [**CosmWasm Contract**](/developers/cosmwasm):
Service with deployed on-chain logic,
objectively verifiable and irrefutable by the network,
driven primarily by the contract code.
- [**Program-agnostic**](/developers/program-agnostic):
Service with a program-agnostic and/or chain-agnostic logic
that can be verified by the network,
but not necessarily on-chain.
This allows a wider range of services that can utilize shared security.

## Lifecycle of a Bitcoin Validated Service (BVS)

Regardless of the type of service,
the lifecycle of a Bitcoin Validated Service (BVS) is the same.
BVS developers integrate with the SatLayer ecosystem through [Core Contracts](/contracts),
either directly as EOA or governed through a set (or singular) smart contract.

The two core contracts utilized by BVS for the entire BVS lifecycle
are [Registry](/cosmwasm/contracts/registry) and [Vault Router](/cosmwasm/contracts/vault-router).

### BVS Registry

The [BVS Registry](/cosmwasm/contracts/registry) is a central record-keeping contract for all Operators and Services within the SatLayer ecosystem.
It serves as a directory where Operators and Services can register themselves and establish mutual relationships.
For on-chain services, the Operator can be queried and asserted to determine if it is validating a Service.

Example for registering a BVS service:

<Tabs items={['CosmWasm Contract', 'Program-agnostic']} storageKey="ServiceType">
  [//]: # (//@formatter:off)
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <>We execute service registration during `pub fn instantiate`, but they can be executed at any time in the contract lifecycle, e.g. during `pub fn migrate` or `pub fn execute`.</>

    ```rust filename="contract.rs"
    #[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
    pub fn instantiate(
        deps: DepsMut,
       _env: Env,
       _info: MessageInfo,
       msg: InstantiateMsg,
    ) -> Result<Response, PauserError> {
        let register: CosmosMsg = cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg::Execute {
            contract_addr: "bbn1qtvnjezrv3fnqvuq869595zq6e2jk0zfhupg52aua0d6ht2a4jjsprqeae".to_string(),
            msg: to_json_binary(&bvs_registry::msg::ExecuteMsg::RegisterAsService {
                // Metadata of the service
                metadata: bvs_registry::msg::Metadata {
                    name: Some("Squaring".to_string()),
                    uri: Some("https://the-squaring-company.com".to_string()),
                },
            })?,
            funds: vec![],
        }
        .into();

        Ok(Response::new()
            .add_message(register))
    }
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <>In this example, we use the [cosmos/cosmjs JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) to register a service but program-agnostic services can be implemented in any language.</>

    ```js filename="init.js"
    const executeMsg = {
      register_as_service: {
        metadata: {
          name: "Squaring",
          uri: "https://the-squaring-company.com",
        },
      },
    };
    const serviceAddress = "bbn...";
    const registryContract = "bbn1qtvnjezrv3fnqvuq869595zq6e2jk0zfhupg52aua0d6ht2a4jjsprqeae";
    const tx = await client.execute(serviceAddress, registryContract, executeMsg, "auto");
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  [//]: # (//@formatter:on)
</Tabs>

### BVS Vault Router

The [BVS Vault Router]((/contracts/vault-router)) is a central contract
that manages the interaction between vaults and other contracts in the SatLayer ecosystem.
As a BVS,
the Vault Router coordinates the programmable slashing of vaults,
serving as the execution layer for the slashing logic.

Example for initializing a slash:

<Tabs items={['CosmWasm Contract', 'Program-agnostic']} storageKey="ServiceType">
  [//]: # (//@formatter:off)
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <>The `CosmosMsg` for slashing requests to the BVS Vault Router contract, this can be called during `pub fn execute`.</>

    ```rust filename="contract.rs"
    let request_slashing = bvs_vault_router::msg::ExecuteMsg::RequestSlashing(
        bvs_vault_router::msg::RequestSlashingPayload {
            operator: operator.to_string(),
            bips: 1,
            timestamp: env.block.time,
            metadata: bvs_vault_router::msg::SlashingMetadata {
                reason: "Invalid Prove".to_string(),
            },
        },
    );
    let slashing_msg: CosmosMsg = cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: "bbn1m2f0ctm657e22p843lgm9pnwlqtnuf3jgln7uyqrw6sy7nd5pc5qaasfud"
            .to_string(),
        msg: to_json_binary(&request_slashing)?,
        funds: vec![],
    }
    .into();
    ```

    <>In this example, we use the [cosmos/cosmjs JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) but program-agnostic services can be implemented in any language.</>

    ```js filename="slashing.js"
    const executeMsg = {
      slashing_request: {
        operator: "bbnoperator",
        bips: 1,
        timestamp: 1234567890,
        metadata: {
          reason: "Reason for slashing",
        }
      },
    };
    const serviceAddress = "bbn...";
    const registryContract = "bbn1qtvnjezrv3fnqvuq869595zq6e2jk0zfhupg52aua0d6ht2a4jjsprqeae";
    const tx = await client.execute(serviceAddress, registryContract, executeMsg, "auto");
    ```

## Next steps

Depending on the type of service you want to build,
the next steps are different.
