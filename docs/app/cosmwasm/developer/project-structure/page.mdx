# CosmWasm Project Structure

This is a high-level overview of a CosmWasm contract to get you started with integrating with the SatLayer ecosystem.
CosmWasm uses idiomatic Rust compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) `target_arch = "wasm32"`.
It assumes you are familiar with basic Rust and the Cosmos SDK as you will be using it to write smart contracts.

There are only about 5 files that you will need to juggle around with,
and only **`contract.rs`** contains the actual logic of the contract.
You will probably be able to learn it alongside when writing your first smart contract,
but I strongly recommend reading these two books if you want to get a deeper understanding.

Above is the typical structure of a CosmWasm project;
we follow the same structure in [CosmWasm/cw-template](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template) the quickstart template
for building CosmWasm contracts.
Although you don't have to follow this structure,
it is highly recommended to do so to make it easier for everyone (e.i, auditors) to understand the project.
The main files that you should be aware of are:
- `contract.rs`: This is the main entry point for the contract.
It contains the logic for handling the messages, mutating the state, and responding to queries.
- `msg.rs`: This file contains the `interfaces`, the message structure for interacting with the contract.
- `state.rs`: This file contains the state, the data that are stored in the contract.

### `msg.rs`

This file contains the messages that are sent to and from the contract.
You should start from this file to define the messages that you want to support.
The `ExecuteMsg` and `QueryMsg` are defined as enums, and each message should have its own variant.

It is important to note that the messages are serialized to JSON before being sent to the contract.
This is done by using the `#[cw_serde]`,
an attribute macro that annotates types with things they need to be properly (de)serialized for use in CosmWasm contract messages and/or responses,
and also for schema generation.

```rust filename="msg.rs"
#[cw_serde]
pub struct InstantiateMsg {
    pub aggregator: String,
}

#[cw_serde]
pub struct MigrateMsg {
    pub aggregator: Option<String>,
}

#[cw_serde]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    Request {
        input: i64,
    },
    Respond {
        input: i64,
        output: i64,
    },
}

#[cw_serde]
pub enum QueryMsg {
    GetRequest {
        input: i64,
    },
    GetResponse {
        input: i64,
    },
}
```

Example of a request message:

```json filename="ExecuteMsg::Request { input: 3 }"
{
   "request": {
      "input": 3
   }
}
```


### `state.rs`

This file contains the state of the contract, data that are stored in the contract.
They are usually brief and only contain a few lines of code defining what's stored in the contract.

- `Item<T>` store a single value of type `T` with a given namespace.
- `Map<K, T>` store a map of type `T` with a given key of type `K` in a given namespace.

```rust filename="state.rs"
pub const AGGREGATOR: Item<Addr> = Item::new("aggregator");
pub const REQUEST_RESPONSE: Map<&i64, i64> = Map::new("request_response");
```

### `contract.rs`

The main `entry_point` and business logic of the contract.
It contains the logic for handling the messages, mutating the state, and responding to queries.

```rust filename="contract.rs"
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, info: MessageInfo, msg: InstantiateMsg) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // Instantiate the contract
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, info: MessageInfo, msg: ExecuteMsg) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        // Match and handle each execute message accordingly
    }
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> Result<Binary, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        // Match and handle each query message accordingly
    }
}
```

### `integration_test.rs`

A simple example of how you can test your contract using `cw-multi-test`.

```rust filename="integration_test.rs"
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    pub fn contract() -> Box<dyn Contract<Empty>> {
        Box::new(ContractWrapper::new(
            contract::execute,
            contract::instantiate,
            contract::query,
        ))
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_request() {
        let mut app = App::default();
        let code_id = app.store_code(contract());

        let init_msg = InstantiateMsg {
            aggregator: app.api().addr_make("aggregator").to_string(),
        };
        let contract_admin = app.api().addr_make("admin");
        let contract_addr = app
            .instantiate_contract(code_id, contract_admin, &init_msg, &[], "Example", None)
            .unwrap();

        let msg = ExecuteMsg::Request { input: 3 };
        let msg_bin = to_json_binary(&msg).unwrap();
        let execute_msg = WasmMsg::Execute {
            contract_addr: self.addr().to_string(),
            msg: msg_bin,
            funds,
        };

        let sender = app.api().addr_make("sender");
        app.execute(sender, execute_msg.into()).unwrap();
    }
}
```
