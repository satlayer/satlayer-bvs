# Deploying CosmWasm Contracts

CosmWasm contracts can be deployed on Babylon Genesis and Babylon Testnet (or CosmWasm-compatible chains)
using the `cosmos-sdk`-compatible command line interface. (The `babylond` CLI is a wrapper around the `cosmos-sdk` Go CLI).

You are not limited to using the `babylond` CLI to deploy CosmWasm contracts.
Another option is to use the [cosmos/cosmjs](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) library
to deploy CosmWasm contracts using JavaScript or TypeScript code.
This guide provides the bare minimum to get you started with deployment operations,
you should develop your own scripts/runbooks for your own operational needs.

## Building

You need to use [CosmWasm/optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/optimizer) to build the contracts.
It is a tool (Dockerfile) to deterministically produce the smallest possible Wasm for your Rust contract.
It will produce an artifacts directory with `<crate_name>.wasm` and `checksums.txt` containing the hashes.

The easiest way to build the contracts is to use the `docker` command.
The artifacts will be available in the `$(pwd)/artifacts` directory after running the command.

```shell
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.16.0
```

## Deploying

For convenience, we will use `docker` to run the `babylond` CLI so you don't need to install the `babylond` CLI locally.

### Prepare Environment

<Tabs items={['Babylon Testnet', 'Babylon Genesis']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <>Copy the `client.toml` file for `bbn-test-5` to the `.babylond/config` directory.</>

    ```toml filename=".babylond/config/client.toml" copy
    chain-id = "bbn-test-5"
    node = "https://babylon-testnet-rpc.nodes.guru"
    keyring-backend = "os"
    output = "text"
    broadcast-mode = "block"
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <>Copy the `client.toml` file for `bbn-1` to the `.babylond/config` directory.</>

    ```toml filename=".babylond/config/client.toml" copy
    chain-id = "bbn-1"
    node = "https://babylon-rpc.polkachu.com"
    keyring-backend = "os"
    output = "text"
    broadcast-mode = "block"
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Start the interactive shell using the `babylond` docker image.
We will bind the current directory `pwd` to the `/home/babylon` directory in the container,
any keys or configuration files will be stored in the current directory.

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/home/babylon docker.io/babylonlabs/babylond:v1.0.1
```

You can verify it is working by running the following command:

```sh
wasmd --help
```

Add a new key for the deployer.
You will be prompted to enter a password and save it,
you will need this password to sign transactionsâ€”**write the password down**.

```sh
wasmd keys add deployer
```

Query the balance, make sure you have enough tokens to deploy the contracts.
Transfer them to the deployer if necessary.

```sh
wasmd query bank balances $(wasmd keys show deployer -a)
```

### Store Code

Upload the contract to the chain by running the `store` command.
- `--from` specifies the key to use for signing the transaction.
- `--gas=auto` automatically estimates the gas required for the transaction by simulating it first.
- `--gas-adjustment=1.3` increases the gas estimate by 30% to account for any discrepancies.
- `--gas-prices=0.005ubbn` specifies the gas price to use for the transaction. Minimum is `0.002ubbn` for `bbn-test-5` and `bbn-1`.
- `--instantiate-anyof-addresses` specifies the addresses that are allowed to instantiate the contract.
This is optional,
but it is recommended to set it to the deployer address to prevent others from instantiating the contract.

```shell
wasmd tx wasm store path/to/artifacts/contract.wasm \
  --from=deployer \
  --gas=auto --gas-adjustment=1.3 --gas-prices=0.005ubbn \
  --instantiate-anyof-addresses=$(wasmd keys show deployer -a)
```

The most convenient way to get the `CODE_ID` is to query the list of codes and find the one you just uploaded.
The `creator:` field should match the address of the deployer.

```shell
wasmd query wasm list-code --reverse --limit=3
```

Alternatively, query the transaction hash to get the `CODE_ID` using the transaction hash.
Below is an example of how to get the `CODE_ID` from the transaction hash using `jq`.

```shell
CODE_ID=$(wasmd query tx $TX_HASH --output=json \
| jq -r '.events[] | select(.type == "store_code") | .attributes[] | select(.key == "code_id") | .value')
echo $CODE_ID
```

### Instantiate Contract

Using the `CODE_ID` from the previous step, instantiate the contract.
The `--admin` is the address that will have admin rights over the contract.
You need to set this if you want to be able to upgrade the contract later.
This is set to the deployer in this example, in production we would set this to a multisig/governance contract.
Followed by the `CODE_ID` and the contract initialization parameters.

> Contract admin is a contract management feature of `wasmd`,
> among many things, it allows the contract to be upgraded later.
> You cannot set this value in the contract, nor can you change it in the contract.
> It is set during the instantiation of the contract by the creator.

```shell
ADMIN=$(wasmd keys show deployer -a)
CODE_ID=''
INIT_JSON='{}'
wasmd tx wasm instantiate --from=deployer --admin=$ADMIN $CODE_ID $INIT_JSON \
  --gas=auto --gas-adjustment=1.3 --gas-prices=0.005ubbn
