# Integrating with SatLayer

Before you integrate with SatLayer,
the [CosmWasm Contract](/cosmwasm/developer)
and [what is a service](/architecture/services)
documentation is a recommended read.
Foundational knowledge of CosmWasm is required to understand the integration process.
Head over to the [Protocol-agnostic](/agnostic/developer) section
if you are looking for a non-CosmWasm Contract integration.

---

To get started, you should install `bvs-registry` and `bvs-vault-router`.
These two packages provide the msg interfaces and types for the BVS Registry and Vault Router contracts.

The `bvs-multi-test` package is a `cw-multi-test`-compatible wrapper
that provides a convenient way to bootstrap all the necessary contracts for testing services in the BVS ecosystem.

```bash filename="Installing" copy
cargo add bvs-registry
cargo add bvs-vault-router
cargo add --dev bvs-multi-test
```

## Registry

The BVS Registry is a central record-keeping contract for all Operators and Services within the SatLayer ecosystem.
It serves as a directory where Operators and Services can register themselves and establish mutual relationships.

### Register as Service

Register an address as a Service with optional metadata.
Services are entities that Operators can run.

```rust filename="contract.rs" copy
fn message() {
    let register_as_service = bvs_registry::msg::ExecuteMsg::RegisterAsService {
        metadata: bvs_registry::msg::Metadata {
            name: Some("My Service".to_string()),
            uri: Some("https://example.com".to_string()),
        },
    };
    let register_msg: CosmosMsg = cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDR,
        msg: to_json_binary(&register_as_service)?,
        funds: vec![],
    }
    .into();
}
```

### Register Operator to Service

Service registers an Operator to run it.
This establishes a relationship between the Service and the Operator.
For a fully active relationship, both the Service and Operator must register with each other.
When both parties have registered, the relationship status becomes "Active" in the Registry.

If the Service has enabled slashing,
the Operator will automatically opt in to the slashing parameters during registration.
This method is essential for creating the network of trusted Operators that can run a Service.

```rust filename="contract.rs" copy
fn message(operator: Addr) {
    let register_operator = bvs_registry::msg::ExecuteMsg::RegisterOperatorToService {
        operator: operator.into(),
    };
    let registry_contract_addr = "bbn1m2f0ctm657e22p843lgm9pnwlqtnuf3jgln7uyqrw6sy7nd5pc5qaasfud";
    let register_msg: CosmosMsg = cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDR,
        msg: to_json_binary(&register_operator)?,
        funds: vec![],
    }
    .into();
}
```

### Update Service Metadata

Update a Service's metadata (name, URI) to reflect changes in the Service's branding.

```rust filename="contract.rs" copy
fn message() {
    let update_metadata = bvs_registry::msg::ExecuteMsg::UpdateServiceMetadata(
        bvs_registry::msg::Metadata {
            name: Some("Updated Service Name".to_string()),
            uri: Some("https://updated-example.com".to_string()),
        },
    );
    let update_msg: CosmosMsg = cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDR,
        msg: to_json_binary(&update_metadata)?,
        funds: vec![],
    }
    .into();
}
```

### Deregister Operator from Service

Service removes an Operator from its list of registered operators.
This is effectively ending the relationship between the Service and the Operator.

```rust filename="contract.rs" copy
fn message(operator: Addr) {
    let deregister_operator = bvs_registry::msg::ExecuteMsg::DeregisterOperatorFromService {
        operator: operator.into(),
    };
    let deregister_msg: CosmosMsg = cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDR,
        msg: to_json_binary(&deregister_operator)?,
        funds: vec![],
    }
    .into();
}
```

### Enable Slashing

This method enables programmable slashing for a Service,
establishing the rules for penalizing Operators who violate service agreements.

The slashing parameters define the destination address for slashed funds,
the maximum percentage of tokens that can be slashed (in basis points, where 10000 = 100%),
and the resolution window (in seconds) during which an Operator can resolve issues before slashing is executed.

When a Service enables or updates slashing parameters, Operators must explicitly opt in to the new parameters,
providing a safeguard against malicious changes.
This mechanism is crucial for maintaining security and accountability in the SatLayer ecosystem.

```rust filename="contract.rs" copy
fn message() {
    let enable_slashing = bvs_registry::msg::ExecuteMsg::EnableSlashing {
        slashing_parameters: bvs_registry::state::SlashingParameters {
            destination: "bbn1destination".to_string(),
            max_slashing_bips: 5000, // 50%
            resolution_window: 86400, // 24 hours in seconds
        },
    };
    let enable_msg: CosmosMsg = cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDR,
        msg: to_json_binary(&enable_slashing)?,
        funds: vec![],
    }
    .into();
}
```

### Disable Slashing

Disable slashing for a Service.

```rust filename="contract.rs" copy
fn message() {
    let disable_slashing = bvs_registry::msg::ExecuteMsg::DisableSlashing {};
    let disable_msg: CosmosMsg = cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDR,
        msg: to_json_binary(&disable_slashing)?,
        funds: vec![],
    }
    .into();
}
```

## Vault Router

The [BVS Vault Router](/cosmwasm/contracts/vault-router) is a central contract
that manages the interaction between vaults and other contracts in the SatLayer ecosystem.
As a BVS,
the Vault Router coordinates the programmable slashing of vaults,
serving as the execution layer for the slashing logic.

<Callout type="info">
  See [Programmable Slashing](/architecture/slashing) for more information on how slashing works.
</Callout>

### Request Slashing

Start the slashing process for an operator.
The Service must be actively registered with the Operator at the specified timestamp,
and the Operator must have opted in to slashing.
The slashing amount (in basis points) cannot exceed the maximum set in the slashing parameters.
The timestamp must be within the allowable slashing window (not too old or in the future),
and the Service must not have another active slashing request against the same Operator.
When successful,
this creates a slashing request with an expiry time based on the resolution window parameter
and returns a unique slashing request ID.

```rust filename="contract.rs" copy
fn message(operator: Addr, env: &Env) {
    let request_slashing = bvs_vault_router::msg::ExecuteMsg::RequestSlashing(
        bvs_vault_router::msg::RequestSlashingPayload {
            operator: operator.to_string(),
            bips: 1,
            timestamp: env.block.time,
            metadata: bvs_vault_router::msg::SlashingMetadata {
                reason: "Reason".to_string(),
            },
        },
    );
    let slashing_msg: CosmosMsg = cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: ROUTER_CONTRACT_ADDR,
        msg: to_json_binary(&request_slashing)?,
        funds: vec![],
    }
    .into();
}
```

### Cancel Slashing

Cancel an in-progress slashing request if the operator has resolved the issue.
Typically, when the Operator has resolved the issue that prompted the slashing.

After the request slashing message is sent,
the Operator has a resolution window (in seconds, as defined in the slashing parameters) to respond.
If the issue is promptly addressed and resolved,
the Service should cancel the slashing process using this method.
The definition of "resolved" is up to the Service to define.

```rust filename="contract.rs" copy
fn message(slashing_id: String) {
    let cancel_slashing = bvs_vault_router::msg::ExecuteMsg::CancelSlashing {
        id: slashing_id,
    };
    let cancel_msg: CosmosMsg = cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: ROUTER_CONTRACT_ADDR,
        msg: to_json_binary(&cancel_slashing)?,
        funds: vec![],
    }
    .into();
}
```

### Lock Slashing

After the request slashing message is sent, if the Operator does not respond or fails to resolve the issue,
the Service can execute this method to lock the specified proportion of the Operator's staked tokens.
After executing the slash, the Vault Router will rebase all affected vaults to reflect the new exchange rate,
ensuring that new deposits will mint a higher share ratio and will not be affected by the slashing.

```rust filename="contract.rs" copy
fn message(slashing_id: String) {
    let lock_slashing = bvs_vault_router::msg::ExecuteMsg::LockSlashing {
        id: slashing_id,
    };
    let lock_msg: CosmosMsg = cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: ROUTER_CONTRACT_ADDR,
        msg: to_json_binary(&lock_slashing)?,
        funds: vec![],
    }
    .into();
}
```

### Finalize Slashing

Move funds from the locked state to the final destination specified in the slashing parameters.

```rust filename="contract.rs" copy
fn message(slashing_id: String) {
    let finalize_slashing = bvs_vault_router::msg::ExecuteMsg::FinalizeSlashing {
        id: slashing_id,
    };
    let finalize_msg: CosmosMsg = cosmwasm_std::WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: ROUTER_CONTRACT_ADDR,
        msg: to_json_binary(&finalize_slashing)?,
        funds: vec![],
    }
    .into();
}
```
