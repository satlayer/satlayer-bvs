# Integrating with Rust

<Callout type="info">
  Using CosmWasm is strictly optional; it depends on the type of service you are building.
</Callout>

This documentation **does not cover everything about CosmWasm**.
It is mainly written
to provide a quick overview of a typical contract structure and how to get started
with writing a contract that **integrates with the SatLayer ecosystem**.

## Getting started with CosmWasm

Not familiar with CosmWasm?
This is a high-level overview of working with CosmWasm contracts.
CosmWasm uses idiomatic Rust compiled into WebAssembly.
You will be able to learn it alongside when writing your first smart contract.
