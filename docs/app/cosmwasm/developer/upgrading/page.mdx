# Upgrading CosmWasm Contracts

To upgrade a contract, you need to upload the new code and then execute the upgrade message.
The upgrade process is similar to the initial deployment, but it requires the contract address and the new code ID.
You must also have the contract's admin address set (`--admin="..."`) to upgrade the contract.

> Contract admin is a contract management feature of `wasmd`,
> among many things, it allows the contract to be upgraded later.
> You cannot set this value in the contract, nor can you change it in the contract.
> It is set during the instantiation of the contract by the creator.
> See [std/src/query/wasm.rs#L57](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/dc70bf3554f63308f681098819854773355b60cb/packages/std/src/query/wasm.rs#L57)
> and [cosmwasm/issues/926](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/926#issuecomment-851259818) for more details.

Follow the [same steps as the initial deployment](/developers/cosmwasm/deploying#store-contract) to upload the new code.

```sh
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=''
CODE_ID=''
MIGRATE_JSON='{}'
wasmd tx wasm migrate --from=deployer $CONTRACT_ADDRESS $CODE_ID $MIGRATE_JSON \
  --gas=auto --gas-adjustment=1.3 --gas-prices=0.005ubbn
```
