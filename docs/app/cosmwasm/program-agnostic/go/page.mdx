# Integrate using Go

The recommended way to integrate a service with Go is to use the official
[Cosmos SDK](github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

```bash filename="cosmos/comos-sdk" copy
go get github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
```

To get started, you should install the `cosmwasm-schema` module.
It contains Go types generated from the CosmWasm contract schemas.
These types allow you to interact with SatLayer contracts in a type-safe manner.

```bash filename="satlayer/satlayer-bvs/modules/cosmwasm-schema" copy
go get github.com/satlayer/satlayer-bvs/modules/cosmwasm-schema
```

We also provide a `cosmwasm-api` module that contains the client context and helper `Query` and `Execute` functions.
This module is a thin wrapper around the Cosmos SDK and provides a convenient way to interact with CosmWasm contracts.
You don't need to use this module if you prefer to use the Cosmos SDK directly.

```bash filename="satlayer/satlayer-bvs/modules/cosmwasm-api" copy
go get github.com/satlayer/satlayer-bvs/modules/cosmwasm-api
```

## Interacting with contracts

For convenience, we provide a `NewClientCtx` function that sets up a client context
with a given RPC endpoint and chain ID.

```go filename="client.go" copy
import (
	cosmwasmapi "github.com/satlayer/satlayer-bvs/cosmwasm-api"
);

RpcEndpoint := "https://babylon-rpc.polkachu.com"
ChainID := "bbn-1"
clientCtx := cosmwasmapi.NewClientCtx(RpcEndpoint, ChainID)
```

To perform a query, you can use the `Query` function provided by the `cosmwasm-api` package.

```go filename="query.go" copy
import (
	cosmwasmapi "github.com/satlayer/satlayer-bvs/cosmwasm-api";
	"github.com/satlayer/satlayer-bvs/cosmwasm-schema/registry"
)

func PerformQuery() {
	queryMsg := registry.QueryMsg{
		Status: &registry.Status{
			Operator: "bbnoperator",
			Service:  "bbnservice",
		},
	}

	clientCtx := cosmwasmapi.NewClientCtx("https://babylon-rpc.polkachu.com", "bbn-1")

	response, err := cosmwasmapi.Query[registry.StatusResponse](
		clientCtx,
		context.Background(),
		"bbn...",
		queryMsg,
	)
}
```

To perform a execute transaction, you can use the `Execute` function provided by the `cosmwasm-api` package.

```go filename="execute.go" copy
import (
	cosmwasmapi "github.com/satlayer/satlayer-bvs/cosmwasm-api";
	"github.com/satlayer/satlayer-bvs/cosmwasm-schema/registry"
)

func PerformExecute() {
	clientCtx := cosmwasmapi.NewClientCtx("https://babylon-rpc.polkachu.com", "bbn-1").
		WithKeyring(clientKeyring).
		WithFromAddress(executorAddr).
		WithFromName("executor")

	executeMsg := registry.ExecuteMsg{
		RegisterOperatorToService: &registry.RegisterOperatorToService{
			Operator: "bbnoperator",
		},
	}

	executeOptions := cosmwasmapi.DefaultBroadcastOptions().
		WithContractAddr(s.pauser.Address).
		WithExecuteMsg(executeMsg).
		WithGasPrice("0.002ubbn")

	response, err := cosmwasmapi.Execute(
		clientCtx,
		context.Background(),
		owner.String(),
		executeOptions,
	)
}
```
