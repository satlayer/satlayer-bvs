# Integrate using JavaScript

The recommended way to integrate a service with JavaScript or TypeScript is using
the [CosmJS SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs).

```bash filename="@cosmjs" copy
npm i @cosmjs/proto-signing
npm i @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate
npm i @cosmjs/stargate
```

You should also install `@satlayer/cosmwasm-schema`.
This package provides the msg interfaces and types for the BVS Registry and Vault Router contracts.
We provide types for various other contracts as well, but those are optional for most use-cases.

```bash filename="@satlayer" copy
npm i @satlayer/cosmwasm-schema
```

## Interacting with contracts

In this example,
we set up a signing client using a mnemonic with a provided endpoint and fixed gas price.

```js filename="wallet.js" copy
import { DirectSecp256k1HdWallet } from "@cosmjs/proto-signing";
import { SigningCosmWasmClient } from "@cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate";
import { GasPrice } from "@cosmjs/stargate";

// Set up the signer
const secret = "load in from somewhere secure";
const signer = await DirectSecp256k1HdWallet.fromMnemonic(secret, {
  prefix: "bbn"
});

const endpoint = "https://babylon-rpc.polkachu.com";
const client = await SigningCosmWasmClient.connectWithSigner(endpoint, signer, {
  gasPrice: GasPrice.fromString("0.002000ubbn"),
});
```

Executing a transaction is simple:

```js filename="execute.js" copy
const executeMsg = {
  message: {
    payload: "Hello, world!",
  }
};
const [Account] = await signer.getAccounts();
const contractAddress = 'bbn...';
const txn = await client.execute(Account.address, contractAddress, executeMsg, 'auto');
```
