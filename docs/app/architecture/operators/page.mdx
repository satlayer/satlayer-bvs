# Operators

Together with [Services](/architecture/services), Operators form the backbone of the SatLayer ecosystem.
They are responsible for running operations on behalf of the Services,
securing networks, and ensuring the integrity of the underlying Services by providing infrastructure and validation resources.
Simply put, Operators are operators of a service.

Operators are the validators, infrastructure providers, and operational backbone of the ecosystem.
They play a crucial role in maintaining the security, reliability, and functionality of various services.
Operators provide the necessary computational resources, security measures,
and technical expertise required to ensure that services operate efficiently and securely.

Being an operator isn't just about their ability to "run nodes."
It's about providing professional infrastructure for the underlying services,
ensuring high availability, performance, and security.
Operators invest in robust hardware, secure environments,
and technical expertise to deliver reliable service operation.

> Beyond SatLayer, operators as a whole are an important part of the crypto ecosystem.
> They provide the foundational infrastructure that enables protocols and decentralized applications to function.
> Without reliable operators, many blockchain networks and decentralized services would struggle to maintain security, performance, and reliability.

  **Services without operations?**<br/>
  Although operators are mostly thought of as validators, not all services require logic or binary to be run.
  Operators coordinate with services beyond running infrastructure.
  They work with liquidity providers to validate services' runtime and health.

  This could involve backstopping liquidity
  or providing liquidity to the service in situations where the service is under duress,
  ensuring the service remains operational even during challenging conditions.

## Overview of Responsibilities

Operators contribute significantly to the decentralization of blockchain networks
by distributing validation and consensus responsibilities across multiple independent entities.
This distribution of power is fundamental to the trustless nature of blockchain technology,
preventing single points of failure and reducing the risk of centralized control.

The responsibilities of Operators are not limited to running nodes.
They encompass a wide range of tasks and obligations that ensure the smooth operation of the services they support.
These responsibilities include:

- Run the service's validation logic correctly and honestly
- Maintain high availability and performance standards for infrastructure
- Incentivize restakers (liquidity providers) to stake assets as collateral against malicious behavior
- Follow protocol rules defined by the service
- Keep up with updates and protocol changes
- Report results accurately and in a timely manner
- Coordinate with liquidity providers when necessary
- Provide technical support (if necessary) and troubleshooting for the services they operate
- Accept slashing penalties for failures or malicious behavior

## Registration Lifecycle

The relationship between Operators and Services is bidirectional and requires mutual agreement.
This design ensures that both parties explicitly consent to work together,
enhancing security and reliability in the ecosystem.

- Services and Operators independently register themselves in the BVS Registry
- Services register Operators they want to run their validation logic
- Operators register Services they are willing to validate
- When both parties have registered each other, the relationship becomes "Active"
- If either party decides to end the relationship, they can unregister, changing the status to "Inactive"
- Operators may deregister if they deem the service is not worth their timeâ€”for example,
if there is too much slashing or insufficient rewards

Behind the scenes,
the registration process often involves direct communication between the Operator team and the Service team.
They typically connect and mutually agree on the registration process,
discussing technical requirements, reward structures, and operational expectations.
While this communication is not necessarily a formal process nor required by the protocol,
it is expected and beneficial for both parties.

This collaborative approach is important because Services must make it worthwhile for Operators to run their service.
Without attractive incentives and reasonable requirements, Services may struggle to attract high-quality Operators.
Similarly,
Operators benefit
from understanding the Service's expectations and technical requirements before committing their resources.
This mutual understanding helps establish a strong foundation for a successful working relationship.

  A single operator can validate multiple services, diversifying their operational portfolio.
  Conversely, to separate risk, multiple operators can be created for a single service, enhancing the service's
  resilience and decentralization.

## Economic Incentives

Economic incentives are the driving force behind the Operator-Service relationship in the SatLayer ecosystem.
These incentives create a symbiotic relationship where both parties benefit from their cooperation.
Operators are motivated to provide reliable and secure validation services,
while Services gain the security and infrastructure they need to operate effectively.

The economic model is designed to align the interests of Operators with the success of the Services they support.
By incentivizing restakers (liquidity providers) to stake assets as collateral and earning rewards for their services,
Operators have a financial stake in the proper functioning of the network.
This alignment of incentives helps ensure honest behavior and high-quality service provision.

The ecosystem is built on these mutually beneficial relationships,
where Services provide rewards that make it economically viable for Operators to dedicate their resources,
and Operators provide the security and functionality that Services need to thrive.
This symbiotic relationship creates a sustainable ecosystem where all participants can prosper.

### Rewards and Incentives

Rewards are the positive economic incentives that motivate Operators to provide high-quality services.
The SatLayer ecosystem implements a flexible and efficient rewards distribution system that allows Services to incentivize Operators based on their performance and contribution.

The rewards distribution process works as follows:

1. Services calculate rewards for each Earner (Operators and Stakers) based on their own criteria and discretion.
2. These rewards are recorded in a `distribution.json` file that follows a standardized schema,
tracking the accumulative rewards for each earner.
3. Services generate a merkle root from this distribution file and execute a DistributeRewards function in the `bvs-rewards` contract,
transferring the reward tokens to the contract.
4. Earners can then claim their rewards by providing the necessary merkle proof, which verifies their entitlement to the specified amount.

This approach allows for efficient and scalable rewards distribution, even with a large number of recipients.
It also provides flexibility for Services to implement their own reward calculation logic,
tailoring incentives to their specific needs and priorities.

The rewards system is designed to create a positive feedback loop,
where Operators are incentivized to provide reliable and secure services,
and in turn, receive fair compensation for their contribution.
This alignment of incentives helps ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of the ecosystem.

### Slashing and Penalties

Slashing is a critical mechanism in the SatLayer ecosystem
that ensures Operators maintain high standards of performance and honesty.
When an Operator fails to meet their obligations or engages in malicious behavior, they can be subject to slashing,
where a portion of the assets staked by restakers (liquidity providers) in their vaults is confiscated.

The slashing process is designed to be fair, transparent, and proportional to the severity of the violation.
It follows a structured lifecycle:

1. **Slash Initialize**:
The Service initiates the slashing process by sending a message to the Vault Router,
specifying the Operator, the percentage to slash (in basis points), and a reason for the slash.
2. **Resolution Window**:
After initialization, the Operator has a resolution window (defined by the Service) to address the issue.
If the problem is resolved during this period, the Service can cancel the slashing process.
For objectively verifiable slashing, the resolution window can be set to zero.
3. **Slash Locked**:
If the issue remains unresolved after the resolution window,
the Service executes the slash,
moving funds from the restakers' assets in the Operator's vaults to a locked state.
4. **Slash Finalize**:
Finally, the slashing process is finalized, transferring the locked funds to the designated recipient address.

The slashing parameters,
including the maximum percentage that can be slashed and the resolution window duration,
are defined by the Service and must be explicitly accepted by the Operator.
This opt-in approach ensures that Operators are fully aware of the potential penalties before establishing a relationship with a Service.

Importantly, the system includes guardrails to prevent malicious or disproportionate slashing.
In the current phase,
a trusted governance mechanism reviews slashing actions before finalization,
verifying their legitimacy and proportionality.
