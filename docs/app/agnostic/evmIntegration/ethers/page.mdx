# Integrate using Ethers.js
SatLayer's smart contracts are built for EVM compatibility, allowing them to integrate with the existing EVM developer ecosystem.
This means that standard EVM frameworks, libraries, and tools—such as Ethers.js and Viem—can be used without modification, enabling developers to leverage familiar workflows and infrastructure.

To integrate EVM contracts through [Ethers.js (v6)](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/):

```bash filename="deps" copy
npm i ethers
```
Also, add `@satlayer/contracts` which provides ABI for SatLayer EVM contracts to the project.

```bash filename="SLAYContracts" copy
npm i @satlayer/contracts
```

## Creating programmatic wallet clients.
In this example, we set up a wallet client using a private key.

```js filename="privateKeyBasedWalletClient.js" copy
import { JsonRpcProvider, Wallet } from 'ethers'

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(process.env.RPC_URL)

const wallet = new Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider)

console.log('Using wallet:', await wallet.getAddress())
```

Create a client by providing mnemonics:

```js filename="mnemonicBasedWalletClient.js" copy
import { JsonRpcProvider, Wallet } from 'ethers'

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(process.env.RPC_URL)

const mnemonic = process.env.MNEMONIC

const wallet = Wallet.fromPhrase(mnemonic, provider)

console.log('Using wallet:', await wallet.getAddress())
```

## Interacting with contracts

Executing a transaction is also fairly straightforward; the following snippet will demonstrate interacting with the SLAYRegistry contract to register yourself (or, more accurately, your EOA) as an operator:

```js filename="execute.js" copy
import { Contract, JsonRpcProvider, Wallet } from 'ethers'
import { abi } from '@satlayer/contracts/out/SLAYRegistryV2.sol/SLAYRegistryV2.json'

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(process.env.RPC_URL)
const wallet = new Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider)

const contractAddress = '0x...' // Replace with live/testnet SLAYRegistryV2 address
const registry = new Contract(contractAddress, abi, wallet)

const tx = await registry.registerAsOperator(
  'www.exampleOperator.com',
  'An example operator'
)

console.log('Tx sent:', tx.hash)
const receipt = await tx.wait()
console.log('Mined in block:', receipt.blockNumber)
```
