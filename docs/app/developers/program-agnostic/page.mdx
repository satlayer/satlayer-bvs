# Program-agnostic

Program-agnostic services are programs that can be verified by the network, but not necessarily on-chain.
This makes the SatLayer network agnostic to the underlying implementation of the program.
This type of service is useful for applications that require a high level of flexibility and can be implemented in various programming languages.

<Callout type="info">
  Services that require deployed on-chain logic or objectively verifiable logic
  should be implemented as a [CosmWasm Contract](/developers/cosmwasm).
</Callout>

This allows a wider range of services that can utilize shared security.
Program-agnostic applications can be created
by calling contracts directly without needing to deploy your own smart contracts.
This approach offers flexibility and simplicity for many use cases.

### Key Concepts

- **Direct Contract Interaction**:
Programs can be created by directly calling existing contracts on the network,
eliminating the need to deploy custom contracts for many use cases.
The program-agnostic implementation and lifecycle largely follows the same
pattern as the [CosmWasm Contract](/developers/cosmwasm/integrating) implementation.
- **Address Flexibility**:
The `Addr` type in the system doesn't have to represent a smart contract - it can also be an EOA (Externally Owned Account).
This means you can interact with both contract addresses and regular wallet addresses using the same mechanisms.
- **Simplified Development**:
By leveraging existing contract infrastructure,
you can build applications with less complexity and lower deployment costs.

## Language guides

Program-agnostic services can be written in any programming language or framework,
as a microservice, monolith, or serverless function.
It is essentially agnostic to the environment in which it runs.

JavaScript/TypeScript and Go are the most common languages used to write program-agnostic services.
