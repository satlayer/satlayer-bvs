# Installation

To start writing CosmWasm (cw) smart contracts, you will need Rust installed on your machine.
You can install it by following the instructions on the official Rust website. `https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install`

CosmWasm uses idiomatic Rust compiled to WebAssembly (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`),
you will need the Wasm rust compiler backend installed to build Wasm binaries.
To install it, run:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## CosmWasm Template

If you are looking to quickly bootstrap a blank CosmWasm contract,
the Official [CosmWasm/cw-template](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template)
is the place to start.

To get started, install [cargo-generate](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate) and cargo-run-script.

```sh
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

Now, use it to create your new contract.
Go to the folder in which you want to place it and run:

```sh
cargo generate --git https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template.git --name PROJECT_NAME
```

Head over to [CosmWasm/cw-template/README.md](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template/blob/main/README.md#creating-a-new-repo-from-template)
for the rest of the instructions.
