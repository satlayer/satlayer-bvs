# Introduction

SatLayer is a shared security platform designed to leverage Bitcoin as the primary security collateral.
By deploying as a set of smart contracts on Babylon,
SatLayer enables BTC restakers to secure any type of dApp or protocol as a Bitcoin Validated Service
(BVS).
This means that Bitcoin, the largest and most widely trusted cryptocurrency,
can now provide security to a broad range of applications,
with full Turing-complete programmability while minimizing trust assumptions.
By expanding the ways Bitcoin can be used, SatLayer helps Bitcoin maximizes its potential as a reward-generating asset.
