# Introduction

Welcome to the SatLayer BVS documentation for developers and operators!

## What is SatLayer?

**SatLayer** is a shared security platform designed to leverage Bitcoin as the primary security collateral.
SatLayer enables BTC restakers to secure any type of dApp or protocol as a Bitcoin Validated Service (BVS).

SatLayer generates rewards by staking wrapped Bitcoin or Bitcoin LSTs to secure BVS applications.
These BVS applications distribute their tokens as rewards to Bitcoin restakers who provide collateral,
and operators who help with the validation.

## Main Features

Some of the main SatLayer features include:
