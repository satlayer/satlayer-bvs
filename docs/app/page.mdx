# Introduction

Welcome to the SatLayer BVS documentation for developers and operators!

## What is SatLayer?

**SatLayer** is a shared security platform designed to leverage Bitcoin as the primary security collateral.
SatLayer enables Bitcoin restakers to secure any type of dApp or protocol as a Bitcoin Validated Service (BVS).

SatLayer generates rewards by staking wrapped Bitcoin or Bitcoin LSTs to secure BVS applications.
These BVS applications distribute their tokens as rewards to Bitcoin restakers who provide collateral,
and operators who help with the validation.

By expanding the ways Bitcoin can be used, SatLayer helps Bitcoin maximizes its potential as a reward-generating asset.

## Main Features

Some of the main SatLayer features include:

| Feature                                            | Description                                                                                                                             |
|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Vaults](/getting-started/vaults)                  | The primary interface for users to deposit assets, receive shares, and withdraw assets when needed.                                     |
| [Services](/getting-started/services)              | Applications or protocols that utilize the SatLayer ecosystem for validation and security.                                              |
| [Operators](/getting-started/operators)            | Operators are the validators, infrastructure providers, and operational backbone of the ecosystem.                                      |
| [Programmable Slashing](/getting-started/slashing) | A programmable interface for services to execute slashing to penalize malicious behavior or perform defaulting swaps.                   |
| [Rewards](/getting-started/rewards)   | A system for services to distribute rewards to operators and restakers, ensuring fair and regular compensation for their contributions. |

## Participants

The SatLayer ecosystem consists of the following participants:

- Bitcoin restakers enhance cryptoeconomic security by depositing and restaking their Bitcoin assets, delegating
them to node operators. If a node operator acts maliciously, these assets face the risk of being slashed,
reinforcing cryptoeconomic security. In exchange, Bitcoin restakers earn rewards. Bitcoin restakers can currently
restake wrapped Bitcoin and specific Bitcoin LSTs through the SatLayer Staking App.

- Bitcoin Validated Services (BVS) developers can address the cold-start problem, where new services and protocols
are initially insecureâ€”by launching services secured through SatLayer secured using staked Bitcoin. These services,
called Bitcoin Validated Services (BVS), derive their security from the amount of Bitcoin backing them
(i.e staked Bitcoin).

- Operators are responsible for running nodes to validate BVSs, using stakes delegated to them by Bitcoin
restakers. In exchange for providing the validation service, computing resources, and expertise required to run the
node operator software required for validation (where required), these node operators take a portion of the rewards
as their fee.
