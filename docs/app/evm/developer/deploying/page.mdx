# Deploying Solidity Contracts

Solidity contracts can be deployed on EVM-compatible blockchains through multiple methods.
This page will mainly focus on deploying the contracts with forge scripts.

Forge scripts are a powerful way to deploy and manage your Solidity contracts on EVM networks.
Though it is mainly used to deploy multiple contracts at once, it can also be used to deploy a single contract.
It allows you to write deployment scripts in Solidity, which can be executed using the Foundry toolchain.

## Writing Forge Scripts

Create a script directory in the root of your project and add the script file.

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="my-bvs-service" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="script" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="Deployment.s.sol" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

```solidity filename="Deployment.s.sol" copy
import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {console} from "forge-std/console.sol";

contract DeploymentScript is Script {
    function run() public virtual {
        vm.startBroadcast();

        MyBVSService myBVSService = new MyBVSService();
        console.log("MyBVSService deployed at: %s", address(myBVSService));

        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```

## Deploying

To deploy a dry run of the script, you can use the following command:

```bash
forge script script/Deployment.s.sol:DeploymentScript --chain <CHAIN> --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> -vvvv
```

To deploy the script, you should add `--broadcast` to the command:

```bash
forge script script/Deployment.s.sol:DeploymentScript --broadcast --chain <CHAIN> --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> -vvvv
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to set `--sender` if contracts uses Ownable or similar patterns that require a specific sender address. Else, the default Foundry sender will be used.
</Callout>
