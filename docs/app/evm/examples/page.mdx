# Examples (EVM)

Explore end-to-end examples that show how to build Bitcoin Validated Services
(BVS) that integrate with SatLayer on EVM chains for various use cases.

## Overview

These examples are designed to help you:

- Understand how Services interact with SLAY contracts (Registry, Router, Vaults, Rewards).
- See how off‑chain nodes/operators participate in verification and reward flows.
- Learn typical patterns for broadcasting work, quorum/verification, and finalization.

They are intentionally minimal and link to full README guides for details.

## Available examples

<Callout type="warning">
    These examples are not production ready.
    They are meant to be used as a reference for learning how to build BVSs.
    They are not meant to be used in production.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Solidity and EVM tooling.
- Node.js and a package manager (pnpm or npm).
- Foundry (for projects that compile Solidity) and/or Docker where noted by the example.
- Access to an EVM RPC (for live deployments) — examples default to local tests.

## Lifecycle

Every examples comes with a README that explains the premise of the example.
Lookout for the test file where most of the lifecycle is demonstrated.
The lifecycle test will bring through the setup, registration, and main core lifecycle.
Slashing and Rewards flows will also be demonstrated in some examples.
