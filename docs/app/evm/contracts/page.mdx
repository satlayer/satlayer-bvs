# SLAY Contracts (EVM)

SLAY contracts provide a simple, modular set of contracts to connect [Services](/architecture/services) and [Operators](/architecture/operators), manage vault-based restaking, and coordinate slashing. At a glance:

### SLAY Registry ([ISLAYRegistryV2](/evm/contracts/ISLAYRegistryV2.sol))
- Single source of truth for Services and Operators registration.
- Establishes Service â†” Operator relationships (two-sided consent).
- Holds slashing parameters per Service and requires Operator approval to activate them.
- Enforces limits (max active relationships) and withdrawal-delay compatibility.

### SLAY Router ([ISLAYRouterV2](/evm/contracts/ISLAYRouterV2.sol), [ISLAYRouterSlashingV2](/evm/contracts/ISLAYRouterSlashingV2.sol))
- Central gate for pausing and whitelisting vaults across the system.
- Entrypoint for Services to interact with the vaults.
- Manages Vault whitelisting.
- Provides slashing related functionality.

### SLAY Rewards ([ISLAYRewardsV2](/evm/contracts/ISLAYRewardsV2.sol))
- Services rewards the Operators and Stakers for their contributions in the shared security.
- Earners will be able to claim rewards.
- Uses Merkle proofs to verify claims.

### SLAY VaultFactory ([ISLAYVaultFactoryV2](/evm/contracts/ISLAYVaultFactoryV2.sol))
- Factory for creating SLAY Vaults.
- Delegated to Operators to manage the vaults.

### SLAY Vault ([ISLAYVaultV2](/evm/contracts/ISLAYVaultV2.sol))
- ERC-4626 tokenized vault with async redemption following ERC-7540 patterns.
- Integrates with Registry for operator withdrawal delays used in claim windows.
- Delegated to Operators to manage the vaults.
