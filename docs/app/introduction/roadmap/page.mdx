# Roadmap

## Phase I

In Phase I, SatLayer will enable users to deposit Bitcoin assets and LSTs to vaults on Babylon Genesis.
These assets will accrue SatLayer rewards similarly as SatLayer deposit contracts on other chains.
This stage purely functions as a signalling apparatus for support for the SatLayer protocol.

## Phase II

In Phase II, SatLayer will expand to include the following features:

- Operators can create vaults via the `vault-factory`
- Bitcoin Validated Services (BVSs) can register to vaults and get stake delegated to them
- Slashing enabled over the operators which have delegated stake to a particular BVS using a simple quorum-based model
- Tokenizing Babylon Genesis vaults such that receipt tokens can be issued

## Phase III

In Phase III, SatLayer will enable more slashing modalities, moving closer towards fully programmable slashability of
Bitcoin collateral. It will also enable more flexible movement of slashed funds, such as capture of slashed funds into
a pot which is controllable by unslashed validators. Operators could then vote to redistribute slashed funds over the
remaining set of operators or use those funds for some protocol-specific function (i.e. insurance payout).
