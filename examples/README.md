# Examples

This directory contains examples of BVS (Blockchain Validation Service) implementations organized by their execution environment.

## Directory Structure

- `cw/`: Contains examples implemented using [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/), a smart contract platform for the Cosmos ecosystem.
- `evm/`: Contains examples implemented for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains.

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate how to build and deploy BVS applications in different blockchain environments.
Each example includes both the smart contract code and the corresponding service implementation.

## Getting Started

To work with these examples,
navigate to the specific execution environment directory (`cw/` or `evm/`) and then to the example you're interested in.
Each example contains its own documentation and setup instructions.
