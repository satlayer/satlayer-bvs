# LayerZero DVN Example (EVM control plane)

This example demonstrates how to build DVN + BVS integration with LayerZero for cross-chain packet verification
and broadcasting leveraging on SatLayer's BVS ecosystem in EVM control plane.

For CW control plane, see [layerzero-dvn](https://github.com/satlayer/satlayer-bvs/tree/main/examples/cw/layerzero-dvn).

Typically, each DVN is responsible for verifying packets in LayerZero ecosystem,
by integrating BVS ecosystem in SatLayer, we can leverage cryptoeconomic incentives to secure the verification process.

## Overview

For this example we will build a simple message passing OApp
(`SimpleOApp.sol`) that sends a message packet from eth mainnet to optimism mainnet using custom DVN (`CustomDVN.sol`) and BVS (`BVS.sol`) integration.

### On-chain contracts

#### `CustomDVN`

- An EVM contract to be deployed on Source (ETH) and Destination chains (OP) that implements LayerZero DVN interface.
- It will be the entry point to LZ core contracts for sending and receiving packets.

#### `SimpleOApp`

- An EVM contract that implements LayerZero OApp interface to send and receive packets cross-chain.
- Uses custom routing logic that sends packets through `CustomDVN` for verification.

#### `BVS`

- An EVM contract that acts as a BVS
- It will broadcast packets received from `CustomDVN` to the BVS ecosystem on SatLayer.
- The Operators will listen for broadcasted packets and verify them, submitting the payload hash to the BVS contract.
- Through Quorum, the BVS contract will ensure that the packet is verified by a sufficient number of operators before finalizing it.
- NOTE: this contract is kept simple for demonstration purposes, in production you would want to use a more robust BVS contract.

### Off-chain nodes

#### `DVNNode`

- An off-chain node that integrates `CustomDVN` with `bvs-dvn-contract`.
- It listens for `PacketSent` events from LZ `EndpointV2` and `PacketAssigned` events from `CustomDVN` and then broadcast the relevant packets to `BVS`.
- It also finalizes the payload hash when the quorum of operators has verified the packet.

#### `OperatorNode`

- An off-chain node that listens for broadcasted packets from `BVS`.
- It verifies the packet (i.e., checks the signature and payload)
- It produces payload hash and submits it to the `BVS` as a proof that it has verified the packet.

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

## Build

```bash
# Compile EVM contracts with Foundry.
pnpm run build
```

## Running the lifecycle test

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
# Build the project
pnpm run build
# Run the lifecycle test
pnpm run test
```

### Note

There is a minor difference in the lifecycle test between EVM and CW control plane.
These are done due to gas saving measures.
The main logic flows remain the same.
