 *
 * This defines the different ways tallies can happen. Every contract should support a
 * subset of these, ideally all.

 * proposal starts (this is likely the responsibility of a correct cw4 implementation).
 *
 * Declares that a fixed weight of yes votes is needed to pass. It does not matter how many
 * no votes are cast, or how many do not vote, as long as `weight` yes votes are cast.
 *
 * This is the simplest format and usually suitable for small multisigs of trusted parties,
 * like 3 of 5. (weight: 3, total_weight: 5)
 *
 * A proposal of this type can pass early as soon as the needed weight of yes votes has been
 * cast.
 *
 * Declares a percentage of the total weight that must cast Yes votes, in order for a
 * proposal to pass. The passing weight is computed over the total weight minus the weight
 * of the abstained votes.
 *
 * This is useful for similar circumstances as `AbsoluteCount`, where we have a relatively
 * small set of voters, and participation is required. It is understood that if the voting
 * set (group) changes between different proposals that refer to the same group, each
 * proposal will work with a different set of voter weights (the ones snapshotted at
 * proposal creation), and the passing weight for each proposal will be computed based on
 * the absolute percentage, times the total weights of the members at the time of each
 * proposal creation.
 *
 * Example: we set `percentage` to 51%. Proposal 1 starts when there is a `total_weight` of
 * 5. This will require 3 weight of Yes votes in order to pass. Later, the Proposal 2 starts
 * but the `total_weight` of the group has increased to 9. That proposal will then
 * automatically require 5 Yes of 9 to pass, rather than 3 yes of 9 as would be the case
 * with `AbsoluteCount`.
 *
 * In addition to a `threshold`, declares a `quorum` of the total votes that must
 * participate in the election in order for the vote to be considered at all. Within the
 * votes that were cast, it requires `threshold` votes in favor. That is calculated by
 * ignoring the Abstain votes (they count towards `quorum`, but do not influence
 * `threshold`). That is, we calculate `Yes / (Yes + No + Veto)` and compare it with
 * `threshold` to consider if the proposal was passed.
 *
 * It is rather difficult for a proposal of this type to pass early. That can only happen if
 * the required quorum has been already met, and there are already enough Yes votes for the
 * proposal to pass.
 *
 * 30% Yes votes, 10% No votes, and 20% Abstain would pass early if quorum <= 60% (who has
 * cast votes) and if the threshold is <= 37.5% (the remaining 40% voting no => 30% yes +
 * 50% no). Once the voting period has passed with no additional votes, that same proposal
 * would be considered successful if quorum <= 60% and threshold <= 75% (percent in favor if
 * we ignore abstain votes).
 *
 * This type is more common in general elections, where participation is often expected to
 * be low, and `AbsolutePercentage` would either be too high to pass anything, or allow low
 * percentages to pass, independently of if there was high participation in the election or
 * not.

 *
 * This is useful for similar circumstances as `AbsoluteCount`, where we have a relatively
 * small set of voters, and participation is required. It is understood that if the voting
 * set (group) changes between different proposals that refer to the same group, each
 * proposal will work with a different set of voter weights (the ones snapshotted at
 * proposal creation), and the passing weight for each proposal will be computed based on
 * the absolute percentage, times the total weights of the members at the time of each
 * proposal creation.
 *
 * Example: we set `percentage` to 51%. Proposal 1 starts when there is a `total_weight` of
 * 5. This will require 3 weight of Yes votes in order to pass. Later, the Proposal 2 starts
 * but the `total_weight` of the group has increased to 9. That proposal will then
 * automatically require 5 Yes of 9 to pass, rather than 3 yes of 9 as would be the case
 * with `AbsoluteCount`.
 *
 * In addition to a `threshold`, declares a `quorum` of the total votes that must
 * participate in the election in order for the vote to be considered at all. Within the
 * votes that were cast, it requires `threshold` votes in favor. That is calculated by
 * ignoring the Abstain votes (they count towards `quorum`, but do not influence
 * `threshold`). That is, we calculate `Yes / (Yes + No + Veto)` and compare it with
 * `threshold` to consider if the proposal was passed.
 *
 * It is rather difficult for a proposal of this type to pass early. That can only happen if
 * the required quorum has been already met, and there are already enough Yes votes for the
 * proposal to pass.
 *
 * 30% Yes votes, 10% No votes, and 20% Abstain would pass early if quorum <= 60% (who has
 * cast votes) and if the threshold is <= 37.5% (the remaining 40% voting no => 30% yes +
 * 50% no). Once the voting period has passed with no additional votes, that same proposal
 * would be considered successful if quorum <= 60% and threshold <= 75% (percent in favor if
 * we ignore abstain votes).
 *
 * This type is more common in general elections, where participation is often expected to
 * be low, and `AbsolutePercentage` would either be too high to pass anything, or allow low
 * percentages to pass, independently of if there was high participation in the election or
 * not.

/**
 * This defines the different ways tallies can happen. Every contract should support a

 * The total_weight used for calculating success as well as the weights of each individual

 * proposal starts (this is likely the responsibility of a correct cw4 implementation).
 *
 * Declares that a fixed weight of yes votes is needed to pass. It does not matter how many
 * no votes are cast, or how many do not vote, as long as `weight` yes votes are cast.
 *
 * This is the simplest format and usually suitable for small multisigs of trusted parties,
 * like 3 of 5. (weight: 3, total_weight: 5)
 *
 * A proposal of this type can pass early as soon as the needed weight of yes votes has been
 * cast.
 *
 * Declares a percentage of the total weight that must cast Yes votes, in order for a
